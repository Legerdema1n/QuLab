***1. In vivo imaging study of spinal cord injury***
<br />
{{< figure src="spinal_cord.jpg" caption="**Cellular interaction in spinal cord**" numbered="false" >}}
<br/>
In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. 
We developed a minimally invasive intervertebral window by retaining the ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, 
we study neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observe strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration.
By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming 
at interpretation of spinal cord physiology and pathology.

***2. In vivo metabolic imaging and monitoring of adipose tissue***
<br />

We investigated the metabolic characteristics of adipose tissues in live mouse model using a multiphoton redox ratio,
fluorescence lifetime imaging technology and stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. Our study uncovered significant 
heterogeneity in the cellular structures and metabolic characteristics of thermogenic adipocytes in brown and beige fat.
Subgroups of brown and beige adipocytes were identified based on the distinct lipid size distributions, redox ratios, 
fluorescence lifetimes and thermogenic capacities. The results of our study show that this label-free imaging technique 
can shed new light on in vivo study of metabolic dynamics and heterogeneity of adipose tissues in live organisms.

***3. Quantitative Imaging of Biological Dynamics by Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy***
<br />

Quantitative methods to precisely measure cellular states in vivo have become increasingly important and desirable in modern biology.
We developed a technique based on SRS microscopy of vibrational tags for quantitative imaging of lipid synthesis, lipolysis and
biodistributions in live animals and cells. The technique aims to overcome the major limitations of conventional fluorescent 
and lipid extraction methods that do not provide the capability of in vivo quantitative analysis. Using a hyperspectral SRS (hsSRS)
microscope and subtraction method, we demonstrated the unique capability of hsSRS microscopy in quantitative analysis of lipid metabolism 
in vivo. We reported a probe, named AIE-SRS-Mito, for imaging mitochondria in live cells via fluorescence (FL) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging.

***4.High-precision single-cell tracing***
<br />

Heterogeneity broadly exists in various cell types both during development and at homeostasis.
Investigating heterogeneity is crucial for comprehensively understanding the complexity of ontogeny,
dynamics, and function of specific cell types. Traditional bulk-labeling techniques are incompetent
to dissect heterogeneity within cell population, while the new single cell lineage tracing methodologies
invented in the last decade can hardly achieve high-fidelity single-cell labeling and long-term in-vivo
observation simultaneously. We developed a high-precision infrared laser-evoked gene operator heat-shock
system to achieve precise single-cell labeling and tracing. In vivo study indicated that this system can
precisely label single cell in brain, muscle and hematopoietic system in zebrafish embryo. Using this system,
we traced the hematopoietic potential of hemogenic endothelium (HE) in the posterior blood island (PBI) of
zebrafish embryo and found that HEs in the PBI are heterogeneous, which contains at least myeloid unipotent
and myeloid-lymphoid bipotent subtypes.
