Heterogeneity broadly exists in various cell types both during development and at homeostasis.
Investigating heterogeneity is crucial for comprehensively understanding the complexity of ontogeny,
dynamics, and function of specific cell types. Traditional bulk-labeling techniques are incompetent
to dissect heterogeneity within cell population, while the new single cell lineage tracing methodologies
invented in the last decade can hardly achieve high-fidelity single-cell labeling and long-term in-vivo
observation simultaneously. We developed a high-precision infrared laser-evoked gene operator heat-shock
system to achieve precise single-cell labeling and tracing. In vivo study indicated that this system can
precisely label single cell in brain, muscle and hematopoietic system in zebrafish embryo. Using this system,
we traced the hematopoietic potential of hemogenic endothelium (HE) in the posterior blood island (PBI) of
zebrafish embryo and found that HEs in the PBI are heterogeneous, which contains at least myeloid unipotent
and myeloid-lymphoid bipotent subtypes.
